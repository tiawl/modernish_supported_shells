If you do not achieve to install the last **modernish** version with a shell version marked as supported, you should look at `runner.sh` script before opening an issue.

If you want to know if an unlisted shell or an unlisted shell version is supported with the last **modernish** version, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/tiawl/modernish_supported_shells/issues).

If your shell is listed here, is marked as unsupported by the last **modernish** version and you want to know why, you should consider the `trace` directory of this repository before opening an issue into the [modernish main project](https://github.com/modernish/modernish).
